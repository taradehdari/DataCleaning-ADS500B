## Data Reduction

Removing the day and month variables from the dataset as they only indicate the timing of the last contact and are not likely to have a significant impact on the outcome variable.

```{r}
#Remove day and month columns
clientdata <- clientdata %>% select(-one_of('day', 'month')) 
View(clientdata)


## Data Normalization
This was an intial attempet at Normalization but upon visualizations we figured another way to normalize data that would help our visualizations to find a perfect model. 

```{r}

#The scale of age and duration is much smaller than the scale of balance. In this case, normalizing these variables to a common range allows comparing variables that are measured on different scales or units.
#Min-Max Normalization using xRescale function to scale the age, balance and duration
#clientdata <- clientdata %>% mutate(age = round(rescale(age, to=c(0,1)),3),
                      #balance = round(rescale(balance, to=c(0,1)),3),
                      #duration = round(rescale(duration, to=c(0,1)),3))
#View(clientdata)
#Summary(clientdata)
```
