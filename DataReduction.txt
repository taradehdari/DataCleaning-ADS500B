## Data Reduction

Removing the day and month variables from the dataset as they only indicate the timing of the last contact and are not likely to have a significant impact on the outcome variable.

```{r}
#Remove day and month columns
clientdata <- clientdata %>% select(-one_of('day', 'month')) 
View(clientdata)
